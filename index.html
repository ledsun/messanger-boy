        <h3>Listening Two</h3>
        It's a good idea to plan your day.
        Each day, when you comu into work, you should make a list of the jobs you need to do.
        But plan carefully.
        You need to know yourself.
        Do you work better in the morning or in the late afternoon?
        You should plan to do the more difficult tasks when you work best.
        However, you need to be flexible.
        Sometimes work comes up or emails come in that you must answer.
        So, leave some time in your plan.
        So make sure your plan to get your important jobs done.

          <h3>Listening Three</h3>
          Okay Kathy, well since this is your first day, let's talk about what you're going to be doing.
          The first thing you need to do when you get to work is report to the floor manager.
          They'll tell you what to do each day.
          You'll be working in the clothing section, so probably you'll be keeping your section clean.
          So, that will mean folding the clothes neatly and putting clothes back on the shelf.
          But when we're busy, your job is to help customers.
          That's the most important thing.

            I like to start my day early.
            So I come in to the office at 7:30.
            Usually I'm the only one in the office, so it's quiet and I can answer my emalis and plan may day.
            Peaple start coming into the office around 8:00 am.
            At 8:30 we always have a short meeting to go over the work for the day.
            At 9 an the phone starts riging, and I'm usuallly quite busy helping customers and fixing problems.
            If it's not busy' I can do my other work, which usually means writing up reports.

            <h3>Listnenig Two</h3> We need to hire a full-time assistant for our CFO. Up to new, we have had three part-time assistants doing the work, however it was quite difficult to share information between the three part-times assistants. So, with the creation of this
            new full-time assistant position, we hope that we can improve communication both within the Accounting department and also between departments. We hope this position can be filled right away, so the person can start their job as soon as possible.

            <h3>Listening Three</h3> Last year, we increased our advertising spending by 75%, but company's investment in advertising has clearly been a good choice. As you can see from the graphs on page five of your report, our sales have gone up by more than 400% since we
            started our TV campaign in May. And our profits have increased 275%. These results are better than we expected, sisce our investment in radio advertising didn't have such good results. Television is more expensive than radio, but I think we
            should continue to make this investment.

            <h3>Listening Four</h3> We've made the very difficult decision to close all of our branches in New Harbor. Since opening them seven yearse ago, we've been proud to be a part of the New Harbor community. Over the years, our brachens have provided many jobs for the
            people of New Harvor, however, our sales have not been good, and our company has been losing money. Our employees in New Harbor have been offered work at our branch locations in Middletown and several have accepted the offer to work there.
