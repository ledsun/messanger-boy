            <h3>Listening Three</h3> Last year, we increased our advertising spending by 75%, but company,s investment in advertising has clearly been a good choice. As you can see from the graphs on page five of your report, our sales have gone up by more than 400% since we
            started our TV campaign in May. And our profits have increased 275%. These results are better than we expected, sisce our investment i radio advertising didn't have such good results. Television is more expensive than radio, but I think we
            should continue to make this investment.
